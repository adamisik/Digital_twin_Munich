# Digital Twin Munich

Model the city of Munich with a data-driven digital twin. The modelling is based on techniques like Sankey diagramms, scatter plots, clustering graphs, map visualisations and regression curves. 

 
## Data Collection

Most of the data is collected from the GENESIS database of the Bavarian institute of statistics: https://www.statistikdaten.bayern.de/genesis/online/logon . Geo-data of Munich's buildings is from the TUM LNS chair. However, the data collection is being constantly updated.

## Sankey Diagramm

## Geo-data Visualisation


## Clustering


### To-Do:
1. Do geo-visualization of electricity and heat demand
2. Update Sankey Diagramm with manufacturing data.
3. Think of possible combinations for scatter plots.
